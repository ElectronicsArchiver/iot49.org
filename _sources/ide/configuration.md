# Configuration

Many aspects of *ide49* are configurable, including:

* [Changing the password](config/password.ipynb),
* Automatic [backups](config/backup.ipynb),
* [Changing the domain name](config/dns.ipynb) from the default http://iot49.local,
* [Configure your browser/OS](config/https.ipynb) to treat the domain as secure,
* Setting up a [Samba](config/samba.ipynb) file server or client to export or mount the *ide49* home directory, (`/home/iot`).

For further customizations such as installing additional software or adding and removing services you can [rebuild the Balena *ide49* application](app/customize.ipynb).
