# Configuration

Many aspects of *ide49* are configurable, including:

* [Changing the password](config/password.ipynb),
* Setting up automatic [backups](config/backup.ipynb),
* [Changing the domain name](config/dns.ipynb) from the default http://iot49.local,
* [Configuring the browser/OS](config/https.ipynb) to stop complaining that http://iot49.local is not secure,
* Setting up a [Samba](config/samba.ipynb) file server or client to export or mount the *ide49* home directory, (`/home/iot`).

Additional customizations are available if you chose a custom installation. Got to [rebuild the Balena *ide49* application](app/customize.ipynb) to learn how to modify *ide49* by changing installed software or adding new features.
